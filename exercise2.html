                <p>The XML Document Type Declaration, commonly known as DTD, is a way to describe XML language precisely. DTDs check vocabulary and validity of the structure of XML documents against grammatical rules of appropriate XML language.
                    An XML DTD can be either specified inside the document, or it can be kept in a separate document and then liked separately

                </h3>
                <p>A DTD is referred to as an internal DTD if elements are declared within the XML files. To refer it as internal DTD, standalone attribute in XML declaration must be set to yes. This means, the declaration works independent of an external source.
